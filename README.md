## About The Project

In this challenge, I will be using two separate APIs together to create an IP Address Tracking app.
The main challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I will be using the IP Geolocation API by IPify. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


Users should be able to:
1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load.
4. Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.


I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- Free IP Geo Location
- Leaflet (map API)

## What I learned
This is my very first project on Frontend Mentor using API. I decided to spend more time on it from now on. I already have a project using API which was my very first experience, you can check it [here](https://github.com/catherineisonline/covid19-awareness) I decided not to spend too much time and effort on the design as my main goal here is practicing API.

# Important Update

For some reason the limit of 1000 requests has ended very fast. Possible my API key isn't hidden well enough, I am not sure and didn't test it much. The limit doesn't seem to be available once it's used up and this project is not worth any financial investment right now. I changed to another API and hoping that it will work however it does lack some information like ISP, for example. For now I decided to leave this way. The new API I used is provided down below. 
For some reason the gitignore is havin'g issues so I decided to keep the API key visible on purpose. 

## Useful resources

1. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
4. [Leaflet](https://geo.ipify.org/) - an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
5. [Free IP Geo Location](https://ipgeolocation.io/) - provides a free IP gelocation API for software developers I am currently using. This is a temporary replacement
